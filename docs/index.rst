=====================================================
Diagnostics - A toolbox for analyzing diagnostic data
=====================================================

|

diagnostics is a Python module designed to make analysis of diagnostic data easier.
It comes with a couple of clear data-structures with automatic quality checks, easy
Boolean logic operators and built-in bookkeeping. To top that off, it's built on
`numpy! <https://www.numpy.org>`_

diagnostics is free to use (`MIT license <https://github.com/tim00w/diagnostics/blob/master/LICENSE>`_),
open source (`GitHub <https://github.com/tim00w/diagnostics>`_),
works with python 3.5+ and is available for Linux, OSX, and Windows.
